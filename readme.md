# Transform PHP Vars to JavaScript

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laracasts/PHP-Vars-To-Js-Transformer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/laracasts/PHP-Vars-To-Js-Transformer)

Often, you'll find yourself in situations, where you want to pass some server-side string/array/collection/whatever
to your JavaScript. Traditionally, this can be a bit of a pain - especially as your app grows.

This package simplifies the process drastically.

## Installation

Begin by installing this package through Composer.

```js
{
    "require": {
		"laracasts/utilities": "~1.0"
	}
}
```

### Laravel Users

If you are a Laravel user, then there is a service provider that you can make use of to automatically prepare the bindings and such.

```php

// app/config/app.php

'providers' => [
    '...',
    'Laracasts\Utilities\UtilitiesServiceProvider'
];
```

When this provider is booted, you'll have access to a helpful `JavaScript` facade, which you may use in your controllers.

```php
public function index()
{
    JavaScript::put([
        'foo' => 'bar',
        'user' => User::first(),
        'age' => 29
    ]);

    return View::make('hello');
}
```

Using the code above, you'll now be able to access `foo`, `user`, and `age` from your JavaScript.

```js
console.log(foo); // bar
console.log(user); // User Obj
console.log(age); // 29
```

### Defaults

If using Laravel, there are only two configuration options that you'll need to worry about. First, publish the default configuration.

```bash
php artisan config:publish laracasts/utilities
```

This will add a new configuration file to: `app/config/packages/laracasts/utilities`.

```php

<?php

return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | View to Bind JavaScript Vars To
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Set this value to the name of the view (or partial) that
    | you want to prepend the JavaScript variables to.
    |
    | Accepts a string or an array
    |
    */
    'bind_js_vars_to_this_view' => 'hello',

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | JavaScript Namespace
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | By default, we'll add variables to the global window object.
    | It's recommended that you change this to some namespace - anything.
    | That way, from your JS, you may do something like `Laracasts.myVar`.
    |
    */
    'js_namespace' => 'window'

];
```

#### bind_js_vars_to_this_view

You need to update this file to specify which view you want the new transformed JavaScript variables to be prepended to. Typically, your footer is a good place for this.
If you include something like a `layouts/partials/footer` partial, where you store your footer and script references, then make the `bind_js_vars_to_this_view` key equal to that path. Behind the scenes, the Laravel implementation of this package will listen for when that view is composed, and essentially paste the JS variables within it.

If wanting to use this across multiple views, simply set the value to an array, passing in the names of all views you want to utilise the Vars, such as...

```
'bind_js_vars_to_this_view' => [
    'hello',
    'someotherview',
]
```

#### js_namespace

By default, all JavaScript vars will be nested under the global `window` object. You'll likely want to change this. Update the
`js_namespace` key with the name of your desired JavaScript namespace. It can be anything. Just remember: if you change this setting (which you should),
then you'll access all variables, like so:

```js
MyNewNamespace.varName
```

### Without Laravel

If you're not using Laravel, then you'll need to hard-wire things yourself. (Or, feel free to submit a pull request with an implementation for your desired framework.)

First, create an implementation of the `Laracasts\Utilities\JavaScript\ViewBinder` interface. This class is in charge of inserting the given JavaScript into your view/page.

```php
<?php

class MyAppViewBinder implements Laracasts\Utilities\JavaScript\ViewBinder {

    // $js will contain your JS-formatted variable initializations
    public function bind($js)
    {
        // Do what you need to do to add this JavaScript to
        // the appropriate place in your app.
    }
}
```

Next, put it all together:

```php
$binder = new MyAppViewBinder;
$javascript = new PHPToJavaScriptTransformer($binder, 'window'); // change window to your desired namespace
$javascript->put(['foo' => 'bar']);
```

Now, you can access `window.foo` from your JavaScript.

Remember, though, this is only necessary if you aren't using Laravel. If you are, then just reference the service provider, as demonstrated above.
